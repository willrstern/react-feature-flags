/* Look Ma, no CSS! */

/*

Tailwind is my favorite CSS workflow these days - ESPECIALLY for React apps.
You spend a little time defining the colors, argins, fonts, etc for your theme
and the rest of the time, you spend just consuming the utility classes it generates.

It basically equates to a CSS-less UI design workflow.
- You never target CSS to specific elements
- Components can be moved anywhere in the tree with you CSS side effects
- Building out a component library that extends the utility classes is super easy
